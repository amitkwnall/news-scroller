# Release 1.2 #
  * Renamed object NewsTicker (was Ticker). This is a breaking change, you will need to update your files. Why: Ticker is too generic and prone to name clashes.
  * Fixed bug of scrolling immediately upon startup
  * Added pausing of scroll when mouse is in the ticker area.
  * Added option of no\_mouse\_pause. Default is false (mouse causes pause).
  * Commented newsticker file.
  * Made newsticker file into a proper library file--moved the invocation to the sample index file.
  * Changed example to load JS at end as recommended by http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html
  * Tested with Google api service--using them to serve mootools.
  * Tested with Win IE 7, Chrome, FF, Safari
